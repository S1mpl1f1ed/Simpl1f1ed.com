# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most up-to-date version of the code will be actively supported with security updates.

We highly encourage all users and contributors to use the latest stable release of the project to ensure they have access to the most recent security patches and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, we appreciate your responsible disclosure. Please report it to our security team privately by emailing [mscheiterle@simpl1f1ed.com]. 

To help us better understand and address the issue, please include the following details in your report:

- Your name and affiliation (if any).
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code, if applicable.
- Your suggested mitigation or fix (if you have one).

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and strive to provide a timeline for resolution or further actions within 7 days.

## Updates and Security Fixes

Security fixes will be promptly addressed in the most recent version of the project. We will make reasonable efforts to backport critical security fixes to the previous stable release whenever possible.

We encourage all users to keep their installations up-to-date and regularly check for updates or security announcements. Subscribing to our mailing list or monitoring our repository is an effective way to stay informed about the latest releases and security updates.

## End-of-Life Policy

Older versions of the project may reach the end of their support lifecycle. Once a version is no longer supported, it will not receive any further security updates, and users will be urged to upgrade to a supported release.

We understand that upgrading may require effort, but it is crucial to maintain a secure and reliable environment for all users.

## Attribution
